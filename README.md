# Image Processing Application
This is an image processing application written in C++.
It is designed to read various image formats and perform transformations, such as scaling, cropping, flipping vertically, color inverting, etc. 
While it currently only supports BMP files, the application is intended to be expanded to work with multiple image formats.
